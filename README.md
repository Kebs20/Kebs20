# 👋 Hey, I'm Kebs

### 🛠️ Minecraft Content Creator • Quest Designer • Pixel Artist

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I mainly work on creating immersive and story-driven **BetonQuest** quests, but I also enjoy making **pixel art** and crafting **simple MythicMobs configurations**.

## 🔮 What I Do

### 📘 BetonQuest
- Complex questlines  
- Custom objectives and events  
- Dialogue-heavy story content  
- RPG-style systems and mechanics  
- Server-friendly, optimized scripts
- MythicMobs configs that are part of the Quest like NPCs or Mobs behaviour

### 🎨 Pixel Art
- Icons and small sprites  
- Configurations for plugins and resource packs 

### 🐉 MythicMobs
- Simple mob configurations  
- Basic skills, drops, and behavior logic  
- Lightweight, easy-to-edit files  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build high-quality quest packs and tools for server owners  
- Expand my pixel art portfolio
